So when we discovered the best Asian crispy chicken in New York City’s grungy subway scene, we knew we had to share it. And so began the revolution of crispy chicken. \n\n   Spicy, crispy, unique and downright addictive – it’s chicken that’s so bad, it’s good. And there are thousands who would agree with us."
